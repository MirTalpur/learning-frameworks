save: This saves the dependency in the dependencies section. It is available through all the development life cycle.
save-dev: This saves the dependency in the devDependencies section. It is only available in development and does not get deployed into production.
save-optional: This adds a dependency (such as save), but lets npm continue if the dependency can't be found. It is up to the app to handle the lack of this dependency.

npm install –g pm2
The –g flags instruct npm to globally install PM2, so it is available in the system, not in the app. 
This means that when the previous command finishes, pm2 is available as a command in the console.
If you run pm2 help in a terminal, you can see the help of PM2.

JavaScript treats functions as first-level objects so that they can be passed as other functions arguments
as a parameter that, in the Node.js world, is called callback

the createServer() method accepts a callback that will be executed in the event of an HTTP request, 
but meanwhile, the thread is free to keep executing other actions.

The catch in this model is what Node.js developers call the callback hell. The code gets complicated 
as every single action that is a response to a blocking action has to be processed on a callback, 
like in the previous example; the function used as a parameter to the createServer() method is a 
good example.

SOLID Design principles:
Single responsibility principle
Open for extension, closed for modification
Liskov substitution
Interface segregation
Dependency inversion (inversion of control and dependency injection)

module.exports variable exports the modules to the outside world
